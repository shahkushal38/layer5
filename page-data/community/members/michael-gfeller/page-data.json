It started with IT infrastructure and continued with Java-based enterprise applications. In recent years, my focus shifted to cloud architecture, DevOps and modern software development. In modern distributed architectures, I find services meshes especially fascinating. There, simplicity handles complexity. I started to program around 1980 and have used many programming languages since then. My favorite languages are Clojure and PostScript.","image_path":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8d8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/072a341a428f661949e7a6fda32a5cc8/14c24/michael-gfeller.jpg","srcSet":"/static/072a341a428f661949e7a6fda32a5cc8/e2afd/michael-gfeller.jpg 110w,\n/static/072a341a428f661949e7a6fda32a5cc8/2b27b/michael-gfeller.jpg 220w,\n/static/072a341a428f661949e7a6fda32a5cc8/14c24/michael-gfeller.jpg 440w","sizes":"(min-width: 440px) 440px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/072a341a428f661949e7a6fda32a5cc8/8c6ff/michael-gfeller.webp 110w,\n/static/072a341a428f661949e7a6fda32a5cc8/4c27b/michael-gfeller.webp 220w,\n/static/072a341a428f661949e7a6fda32a5cc8/262c3/michael-gfeller.webp 440w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 440px) 440px, 100vw"}]},"width":500,"height":500}},"extension":"jpeg","publicURL":"/static/072a341a428f661949e7a6fda32a5cc8/michael-gfeller.jpeg"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/community/members/michael-gfeller"}},
