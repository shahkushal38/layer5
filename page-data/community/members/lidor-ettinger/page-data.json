I chose a three year path in computer science and quickly discovered it was my specialty. I continued my studies into my college undergraduate degree and was selected for a leadership program. I now have been in the software engineering industry for over four years. As a creative developer I have been involved with expanding infrastructure and operating production enviornments. My specialty is building resilient, robust and innovative solutions. I invest my spare time with the open source community in order to contribute my skills and knowledge.","image_path":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#c8c8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ee545b052a917eddf21b1dd6899799c1/dd515/lidor-ettinger.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ee545b052a917eddf21b1dd6899799c1/6ac16/lidor-ettinger.jpg 50w,\n/static/ee545b052a917eddf21b1dd6899799c1/e07e1/lidor-ettinger.jpg 100w,\n/static/ee545b052a917eddf21b1dd6899799c1/dd515/lidor-ettinger.jpg 200w","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ee545b052a917eddf21b1dd6899799c1/dbc4a/lidor-ettinger.webp 50w,\n/static/ee545b052a917eddf21b1dd6899799c1/d8057/lidor-ettinger.webp 100w,\n/static/ee545b052a917eddf21b1dd6899799c1/2e34e/lidor-ettinger.webp 200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"}]},"width":500,"height":500}},"extension":"jpeg","publicURL":"/static/ee545b052a917eddf21b1dd6899799c1/lidor-ettinger.jpeg"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/community/members/lidor-ettinger"}},
